# Heart Cards Application and Tutorial

## What is HEART?

Google invented the HEART process, which stands for Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention and Task Success.

The HEART process takes a more holistic approach and recognizes the need to gather quantitive as well as qualitative feedback when assessing the success of a software initiative.

You can read more about HEART here: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/google-s-heart-framework-for-measuring-ux

If you are on a journey of continuous improvement, HEART can help you stay true to a build-measure-learn software development lifecycle and can unite designers, developers, product managers, and testers.


## The Heart Cards Application

This *Heat Cards* application provides a digital platform to track and manage a HEART process.

*Heart Cards* is also a fully featured Hyperloop application which demonstrates all aspects of the Hyperloop Isomorphic COMPS architecture.

## This tutorial

Please see [the original tutorial for learning hyperloop](https://github.com/barriehadfield/heart-cards). The code here is just to experiment.
